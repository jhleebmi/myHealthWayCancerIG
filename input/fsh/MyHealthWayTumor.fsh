Title:          "MyHealthWay Cancer Tumor Profile"
Description:    "Identifies a tumor that has not been removed from the body. Whenever possible, a single resource conforming to this profile will be used to track a tumor over time (as opposed to creating new Tumor-conforming BodyStructure resources each time that tumor is measured). Use HumanSpecimen to represent the tumor after removal from the body. \nNote that the required code for morphology used in STU2 is now inactive.  A new code has been specified and SHOULD be used, but the old code remains conformant."
